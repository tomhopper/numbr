Description: Basic mathematical operations, including checking if a 
  vector contains IEEE-754 integers, calculating the geometric mean 
  of a vector, determining the modal value of a vector, extracting 
  the mantissa and exponent of a number, and some statistical 
  summaries of models. Finally, provides a function for converting 
  numbers into their English word equivalent. E.g. 1.23e+9 as
